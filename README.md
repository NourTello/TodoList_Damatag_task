## Overview

The **To-Do List** app allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding new tasks, marking them as completed, deleting them, and saving them across app launches. 

It is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms and uses **Bloc** for state management and **Sqflite** for data persistence. The app has a simple, intuitive UI with visual differentiation between completed and pending tasks.

---

## Features

1. **Task Addition**: Add new tasks by specifying the task title.
2. **Task Viewing**: View all tasks in a list format, where completed tasks are shown with a checkmark and pending tasks are displayed normally.
3. **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or revert them to pending.
4. **Task Deletion**: Delete tasks from the list.
5. **Persistence**: Tasks are saved locally using Sqflite and are retrieved after relaunching the app.
6. **Bloc State Management**: Efficient state management using the Bloc pattern to ensure smooth user interaction and clear separation of concerns.
